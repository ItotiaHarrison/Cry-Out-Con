          fervent desire to manifest inner strength, we create the atmosphere
          needed for every person to discover and unleash their inherent

          closer to God in authentic recognition of His Spirit and an unwavering
          desire to shift the seasons of life. Through the act of “Crying Out,”
          we inspire a resolute commitment to embrace a higher calling, overcome

          fulfillment.
